This is the configuration editor for the Hull Pixelbot Network Client.

Connect the robot to a serial port and then run the program. Select the robot connection from the serial port combo box and then click Connect.

You can edit the WiFi and connection settings for the robot. First Load the settings from the robot and then hit Save to put them back into the network client. 

To test your settings press the Test Settings button. The output window will show the progress as the connection is attempted.

Note that you will need to have pyserial installed for the program to work. It will fail with an error if this is not present.

Have Fun.
